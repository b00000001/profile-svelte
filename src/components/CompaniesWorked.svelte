					I have achieved a certification in Full Stack Development from the University of North
					Carolina, with developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design.
					Known as an innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on
					mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my
					audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development
					in a recent project where I worked in a team of four to develop a single page MERN app
					which leverages AJAX requests to dynamically generate dinner recipes with suggested wine
					pairing and movie suggestions based on user input. Excited to apply my skillset in the
					future as part of a fast paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences
					on the web.
